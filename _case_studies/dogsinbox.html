excerpt: "<p>
  So you want to adopt a black labrador, now what? Chances are you will spend
  the next weeks if not months trying to eagerly refresh the listings of
  countless local and not so local animal shelters hoping to find the one, and
  then hoping that no one else will snatch them up before you.
</p>

<p>
  No more F5’s, no more calling around, no more forgetting to check a site only
  to realise the next day that you’ve just missed the perfect pooch.

<h2>Website</h2>
<p>
  <a href="https://themayhew.org/dogs" target="_blank"
    >The Mayhew Animal Home <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i

</p>

<h2>User persona</h2>
<p>

    >John, 47, <em>small business owner, lives within 10 miles</em></strong

</p>
<p>Wants to adopt a - preferably - young black labrador as a family dog.</p>
<p>
  Haven’t adopted from us before therefore his main point of contact is our
  website.
</p>
<p>Does not follow us on social media.</p>
<h2>Pain points:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Looking for a specific breed of dog can take considerable time having to go
    through several dog shelter websites due to a lack of real central database.
  </li>
  <li>
    More popular breeds/ages tend to get adopted within hours of being added to
    the listing page.
  </li>
  <li>
    Some users might not even return opting on keeping up with only the more
    high frequency animal homes.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Mayhew had - on average - 4 new dogs come up for adoption in a month
    which is comparatively low and affects the number of returning potential
    adopters.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>
  We’ve added a CTA at the bottom of the dog and cat listing pages to invite
  potential adopters to sign up to our email alerts. These alerts are sent out
  every time an animal is published on the site.
</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
  Within its first year we’ve achieved over 1000 subscribers and a consistent
  growth of 15% month to month. A rise in returning visitors to the dog listing
  page.
</p>

<h3>Catnotes</h3>
<p>
  Whilst the CTA has been added to the cat listing pages as well due to the
  nature of cat adoptions (people only usually have preference of colour and
  age) and the relatively high volume of cats the Mayhew have had, the cat
  alerts were less successful but still was in constant use by hundreds of users
  every month.
