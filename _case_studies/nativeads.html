title: Fighting banner blindness with native 'ads' for fostering
img: assets/img/inlinefoster-hp.jpg
excerpt: "<p>In a quick survey of foster carers we've found that none of them came directly from the website.</p>

<p>Was it the case that none of the website's visitors wanted to volunteer to temporarily open their
  homes to cuddly kittens or a friendly, old labrador or was it just banner
  blindness?</p>"

<h2>Website</h2>
<p>
  <a href="https://themayhew.org/dogs" target="_blank"
    >The Mayhew Animal Home <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i
  ></a>
</p>

<h2>My role</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Website and Digital Officer</strong>
  <br /><em>
    I have analysed the website, collected user and stakeholder feedback then
    made recommendations on changes to be made.</em
  >
</p>

<h2>Initial problem</h2>
<p>
  Not enough foster carer sign ups. They always have to be boosted by a digital
  marketing campaign to create new leads.
</p>

<h2>Insight/research</h2>
<p>
  Asked current foster carers how they've found out about fostering for the
  Mayhew <em>(90% Word of Mouth)</em>
</p>

<p>
  Fostering is a relatively unknown concept for many, with a lot of myths
  involved (i.e. it does not, in fact, cost you any money: food, toys and vet
  care is provided by the shelter). These are addressed in social media
  campaigns or WOM talks.
</p>

<p>It's important to seperate two main groups of potential carers:</p>
<h3>
  <img
    class="svg-icon"
    src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/icon-user.svg"
    alt=""
  />The aware user
</h3>
<p>
  Knows what fostering is and is currently thinking of fostering.
</p>
<p>
  Based on user research - whilst with some difficulty - all of them could find
  the <em>Fostering</em> page. Credit to them because it is
  <strong>hard</strong> to find. Improving their journey was added to the UX
  todo list.
</p>

  alt="page with lots of information and only a sidebar link and a text link in a paragraph pointing to fostering"
/>

<h3>
  <img class="svg-icon" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/icon-user.svg"" alt=""
  />The unaware user
</h3>
<p>
  Has no clue about fostering but might consider it.
  <strong>They are our main target audience right now.</strong>
</p>

<p class="skim">
  The real problem: The only potential entry point for an unaware user is a
  banner link.
</p>
<p>
  This link is on the main adoption page that has an average pageview length of
  8 seconds. Of course, it is possible that a user would stumble upon fostering
  whilst looking at volunteering opportunities but those are very low traffic
  pages with people mostly looking for in shelter placements.

<h4>The answer? CTAs? Banner blindness anyone?</h4>
<p>
  We can introduce more informative CTAs that say more than just "Fostering".
  The only issue with this is that our message is then vulnerable to
  <strong>banner blindness</strong>.
</p>

<h2>Solution - Time to go native</h2>

<p>
  Having come from advertising I suggested switching to ‘native ads’, these are
  UI elements that look much like they are part of the content instead of actual
  advertising.
</p>

<p class="skim">
  The listing pages of dogs and cats are the most high-value pages on the
  website with the highest average amount of time spent on just these two pages.
</p>

<h2>Additional features to support fostering</h2>
<p>
  With the plans to introduce filters on listing pages I have also added a
  filter criteria for cats/dogs needing a foster family.
</p>

<h2>Reusability</h2>
<p>
  This method was proposed to be used for fundraising CTAs as well to utilise
  the volume of traffic on the listing pages.
