<a href="https://frontloops.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frontloops</a> is a front-end challenge site by Dimitry Belyaev, a Sr. FE Dev at Booking.com. As part of the challenge you get an image/video file of the final design then off you code.

I've decided to hone my front-end skills a bit whilst **also practicing some UX Design by tweaking the UI** if and when needed. You can find <a href="https://github.com/krisztin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all the code for the below challenges and some others on my github</a>.

## Sign up with Oauth or email

### UX redesign <!-- omit in toc -->

- Got rid of the allcaps buttons for readability.
- positioned social icons next to the button text.
- Added a heading for the email sign up along with a form for quick sign up.
- Added the TOS link because I just **love** the law.
- Following accessibility best practices the *Read our Terms and Service and Privacy Policy* link is not inside the checkbox.

As you can see from the above design solution I'm not a fan of almost explicitly hiding features. On the original design the email sign up is so different in layout/design that it's easy to miss. But **to be true to business needs I did code another version**. And because I'm missing including Javascript in these designs I've added a few lines of JS to deal with switching `display:none` on the sign up form to `block` and it even transforms üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### UX redesign <!-- omit in toc -->

- The active card got a more signified design.
- As there are two screens, to avoid confusion, the active card number is also displayed under the 'Current Balance' title on the right.
- I've added a few filters just for fun. And they actually work! Once again, I was missing a little JavaScript magic so I went ahead and done that.
- Took off the confusing circle border from the + and - icons on incomes and expenditures because they looked like a button.
- Kept a visible scrollbar on both sides as an affordance to signify more content available if scrolled. Did make it a bit fancier looking though.
- Added a - (minus) sign before money going out so colour is not the only visual feedback on the nature of a balance item.

## Order thank you page

{% include imgout.html class="" url='https://res.cloudinary.com/du2vvjrb5/image/upload/v1583082027/krisztin/uiux/d2_e1rnig.png' alt="original vs my design for thank you page UI" caption="original vs my design" %}

### UX redesign <!-- omit in toc -->

#### Information enrichment: <!-- omit in toc -->

- **'my account' label** for the account icon, because icon+label is superior to icon or label only.
- **Thank you heading text** for the skimmers as a quick feedback that all is well.
- **Headers for the order summary** 'table' (i.e. Product name, Quantitiy).
- Quantity column... üôÑ
- **Individual price** displayed under the product's name.
- A **CTA to get in touch**, just in case something went wrong or the user has a question about the order.

#### Layout/accessibility: <!-- omit in toc -->
- **Moved the background image bicycle** so it doesn't overlap with the order details. It's positioned that it also never interferes with the `contact` section.
- **Didn't use a table** for the summary due to accessibility concerns (not just the lack of a consistent way to be read by screen readers but how unpredictable tables are when it comes to sizing on smaller screens).
- Each order item also has an **accessibility text paragraph that collates all the information** in the table/line into one single, uninterrupted paragraph.

## Blocked on Messenger

### UX redesign <!-- omit in toc -->

- Added a `blocked` status indicator icon next to the contact's name.
- Full width system message.
- Link to more info on being blocked *(with accessible text added on at the end to complete the text to: "Learn more about the blocked status.")*
- Disabled the `input field` and `send button` as well.

## Payment method picker

### UX redesign <!-- omit in toc -->

- unchecked inputs' labels are still black; design suggested grey but that could potentially confuse users thinking the option is disabled
- made the container narrower so the checkmark is closer to the label instead of miles away on the right
- design called for all text to be uppercase which is hell on readability
- checked label gets physically larger to give better feedback on it being selected

## Boarding pass

### UX redesign <!-- omit in toc -->

- Information hierarchy: seat, boarding time and airports get priority.
- Passenger name positioned to allow for longer names.
- Broke `departure` into `date` and `boarding` time.
- Headings are not uppercase, instead the information is (as most already is such as gate, flight number, seat).

Broken up to sections as you travel through the airport: from airport names before your flight, the flight number and gate to the QR code for when you check-in then your class and seat as you are about to board.

### UX redesign <!-- omit in toc -->

- Just played around with the design a bit creating `:hover`, `:focus` and `:active` states.
- The small triangle arrow on folders that have subfolders is animated/rotated on folder opening/closing.
- Added some depth for the sub-folders with an inset dropshadow.

### UX redesign <!-- omit in toc -->

This was a great opportunity to improve upon a good looking form with terrible UX design. I wrote an <a href="https://www.kriszt.in/blog/a11yform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">article about the nuances of human-centred form design</a> through making a stunningly designed (not by me) sign in/up form accessible/user-friendly, if you are interested in more detail.

Bottom line is:
- fields should really have 4 borders
- placeholder texts can be confusing to users so best to ditch them. If you want to give instructions you can do so in a paragraph under your label for instance.

Additional stuff (just the usual):
- *grey's, not okay* for button colours as it just makes them look disabled
- STOP SHOUTING AT USERS and help them read your stuff faster.
