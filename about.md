From videos to social media posts, emails and websites this digital veteran has seen it all and made it organically convert better. The secret? Knowing who the audience is and what they want and anticipating their needs; mainly by looking at lots of analytics dashboards and Excel spreadsheets but also by gathering user feedback.

## In the last 20ish years I was:

- Social Media Consultant for both small local businesses and big brands like BMW,
- Head of Audience Development at a YouTube Multi-Channel Network managing more than 40 channels from major broadcasters to brands and classic YouTubers,
- User Experience (UX) Designer and Developer for charities and in the public sector.

## From kittens to code

When I moved to the UK I was delighted to learn you could work in the non-profit sector and did so as a Website and Digital Officer for The Mayhew Animal Home. The position was a mix of digital marketing - the job that I had been doing for years beforehand - and web development.

<p class="skim">I've always thoroughly enjoyed solving real-life problems with digital products.</p>

I've been introduced to the world of UX development and Design Thinking and was immediately taken to it eventually moving on to being a UX Developer - a mix of a UX Designer who can code and a Frontend Developer who actually likes users.

## I ❤️ <span class="a11ytxt">love</span> accessibility

**Accessibility is not just about screen readers**, blind users and not forgetting about proper contrast levels. It is so much more. It’s about properly sized touch targets, thinking about slow internet connections and readability, to name a few... When done right accessibility actually **adds a lot to the usability of your interface**.

## Behind the scenes

Avid hiker, rower and biker (but still spend way too much time sitting in front of the computer), lover of science fiction...never seen Star Wars.
