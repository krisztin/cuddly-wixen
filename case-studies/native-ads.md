My role: as full-time Website and Digital Officer I have analysed the website, collected user and stakeholder feedback then made recommendations on changes to be made. If approved I also project managed the development process.
The problem: Very low conversion of foster carers from the website

Insight/research

The most visited pages on the entire site were the dog and cat listing ones where you could see a preview of all available pets. The main adoption page came in third, this was where you could find the primary ‘link’ to fostering. Being a banner image on a high traffic but low page view time page, unsurprisingly, it received little to no clicks each month.

This was a clear case of banner blindness mixed with poor positioning as, despite the main adoption page having heavy traffic, people spent little time here and quickly zoned in on the pages they were actually interested in: cats and/or dogs.

Solution - Time to go native
Having come from advertising I suggested switching to ‘native ads’, these are UI elements that look much like they are part of the content instead of actual advertising.

The best place to put them? The cat and dog listing pages where people spend the most time; people who are actively looking to adopt a pet. Fostering can target the segment who are not too sure about making the full time commitment just yet.

Technical solution
Widget with variable number ‘ad after x cats’ whereas you make the content creator to manually set a priority order. Conversely, for scalability, a function could calculate the position based on the available number of cats/dogs.

Content strategy with a hint of native
One of the easiest solutions were to create content aimed at potential foster carers.
